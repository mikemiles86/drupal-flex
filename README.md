# Session: The Flexiblity of Drupal

## Summary
No other CMS offers more flexibility then Drupal. If you need to implement a piece of functionality or change a piece of data, there are a million different ways you can go about it. However, this flexibility can also be daunting and frustrating.How do you know if you are going about your changes the “right" way? The truth of the matter is that there is no “right" way - just the “right for me” way. Any method you choose will come with it’s own sets of drawbacks and benefits.

In this session we will demonstrate the flexibility of Drupal by going over 8 different ways in Drupal 8 that data can be manipulated. From non-technical methods, "frontend" javascript & templating methods, to "Backend" methods such as building a custom module and overriding services. This session will demonstrate how to implement each one outlining their individual pros and cons, proving that no matter your skill sets you can make Drupal 8 do what you want.
